# Google Analytics Ecommerce Example

This is an example for Ecommerce tracking in Google Analytics. 
For this to work, you need to include your own ID in the form of UA-XXXXXXX-X in the header

Keep in mind that it can take 24 hours to see the results as they are refreshed once a day.
In my experience, doing it before midnight, makes them available in the morning. 
Good to know for experimenting...
